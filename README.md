Gym Website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and FireBase

The websites for Gym would be common in other countries but although we are in 2022 but in India it is very uncommon that a gym is having its own website to showcase themselves and stand out in the crowd. So, to overcome this problem we have created a simple website using firebase to show the details of a fitness club and if a person is interested in joining the club he or she can even become a member by joining the club online!
